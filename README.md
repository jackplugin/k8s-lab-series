# Kubernetes Lab Series on Windows 11 Home with Docker Desktop, WSL2, and Minikube

Welcome to the **Kubernetes Lab Series** ‚Äî a hands-on, experiment-driven guide to learning Kubernetes from scratch on a Windows 11 Home environment. This series is tailored for developers, students, and enthusiasts who want to explore Kubernetes using **WSL2**, **Minikube**, **Docker Desktop**, and a **local web proxy**, all without needing Windows Pro or a cloud subscription.

Each lab is a self-contained exercise focusing on a key concept in Kubernetes, from cluster setup to DevOps workflows.
